Every `.qmd` article must have _at least_ the following frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: "A Bangin' Title"
description: | 
  Crisp and succint description
author:
  - first_name: "YOUR FIRST NAME"
    last_name: "YOUR LAST NAME"
    url: https://example.com
    affiliation: The High Order
    affiliation_url: https://www.example.com
layout: default
---
```
If adding tags, make sure they are wrapped in square brackets
```yaml
tags: [math, science]
```
